# Scalbl CRM

A simple internal CRM prototype covering conversations, contacts, a powerdialler, clients, and settings.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL in your browser.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Calling (Twilio)

The Powerdialler's Call button places real calls the same way GoHighLevel's
dialler does: the browser registers as a Twilio Voice "device" (a softphone),
so calls ring through the rep's mic/speakers instead of their actual phone.
Twilio credentials never reach the browser — a small backend in `/server`
mints short-lived call tokens and tells Twilio who to dial.

### 1. Set up Twilio

1. Create a Twilio account and buy a phone number (Console → Phone Numbers).
2. Console → Account → **API keys & tokens** → create a Standard API key.
   Note the SID and Secret — the secret is only shown once.
3. Console → Voice → TwiML → **TwiML Apps** → create one. Leave the Voice
   webhook blank for now — you'll fill it in once you have a public URL for
   `/api/voice` (see step 3 below).

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_API_KEY_SID`, `TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET`,
`TWILIO_TWIML_APP_SID`, and `TWILIO_CALLER_ID` (the number from step 1).

### 3. Run the app + calling server together

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This runs the Vite frontend and the Express calling server (`/server`,
default port 3001) side by side. `npm run server` runs just the backend.

Twilio needs to reach `/api/voice` on the backend to know who to dial, so in
local dev expose it with a tunnel (e.g. `ngrok http 3001`) and paste the
resulting URL + `/api/voice` into the TwiML App's Voice webhook (method
`POST`). In production, point it at your deployed backend's `/api/voice`.

### How it fits together

- `src/lib/twilioDevice.js` — frontend wrapper around the Twilio Voice SDK;
  fetches a token, registers the browser as a calling device, places/ends calls.
- `server/index.js` — mints Access Tokens (`GET /api/token`), answers Twilio's
  voice webhook (`POST /api/voice`) with who to dial, and logs call status
  events (`POST /api/status`).
- If Twilio isn't configured yet, the Call button surfaces a clear error in
  the Powerdialler instead of failing silently.
